          <h3>This site has now been closed down</h3>
          <p>
            This page was setup to utilise the data feed that the Government of Jersey was providing on the Covid19 cases, tests and vaccines in the island of Jersey during the 2020 pandemic. This was mainly to both show the data in a better format that originally displayed on gov.je, and be able to show that providing open data in standardised formats can allow others to build on it. 
          </p>
          <p>An occasional problem was caused when the datafeed was updated without warning, usually breaking some things. </p>
          <h2>The last update to feed has done this again... But it's not all bad news.</h2> 
          <p>The update coincided with a large UI update to <a href="https://gov.je/" target="_blank">gov.je</a> as a whole, and now has some very good data visualisation of the Covid-19 data, in ways that are much better than this site offered.</p>

          <p> Thanks to all those who supported this project during a strange time, and especially to <a href="https://rcwd.dev/" target="_blank">Rob Dudley</a> for his support on the API front.</p>
          <p>You will still be able to access the codebase for this project via <a href="https://github.com/bearpig/COVID19_org_je" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
